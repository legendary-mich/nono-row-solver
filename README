Nono Row Solver is a tool used to solve a single row in a popular game called
Nonogram. It is written in typescript, and compiled to javascript (main.js).

Usage: Create a row's description array "var description = [2, 2, 3];" Values 
should be greater than 0. The array itself may be empty. Create a row with 
appropriate values "var row = [-3,-3,-3,-2,-2,-3,-1];". Values inside a row 
should match those in a Cell_State enum , which you can find inside an 
src/interfaces.ts. When you finish, create a Row_Solver "var solver = new 
Row_Solver();", and call solve method filling it with Bounded_Arrays 
"solver.solve(new Bounded_Array(description), new Bounded_Array(row));".  That's 
all. The solver will modify delivered arrays, and will return one of a Result
enum values (changed, unchanged or error).

Sample:
var description = [2, 2, 3];
var row = [-3,-3,-3,-2,-2,-3,-1];
var solver = new Row_Solver();
var result = solver.solve(new Bounded_Array(description),
                          new Bounded_Array(row));
